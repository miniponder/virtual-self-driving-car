# virtual-self-driving-car

this is an applied deep learning project, where a model was developed which can predict the steering angle of the car in real time. computer vision medthods such as data augmentation, batch generation, image preprocessing, were used. the model developed was based on the nvidia model architecture with 5 convolution layers
